# Bug Fix Summary - Version 2.2

## Issue Description
User reported two main issues:
1. **AttributeError**: `'str' object has no attribute 'value'` when adding a dataset and clicking analysis
2. **Missing Dark Mode**: The dark theme was not properly applied throughout the application

## Root Cause Analysis

### AttributeError Issue
- **Location**: `ui_components.py` line 519
- **Cause**: The code was trying to access `.value` attribute on UserProfile enum items incorrectly
- **Specific Error**: `[p.value for p in UserProfile]` was causing issues when UserProfile enum values were being accessed

### Dark Mode Issue
- **Cause**: Dark theme CSS was not comprehensive enough and was being applied too late in the rendering process
- **Missing Elements**: Many Streamlit components were not covered by the dark theme selectors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AttributeError Fix
**File**: `ui_components.py`

#### Changed Profile Selection Logic:
```python
# Before (problematic):
profile = st.selectbox(
    "üë§ Your Role:",
    [p.value for p in UserProfile],
    help="Choose your role to customize the interface and analysis approach"
)

# After (fixed):
profile = st.selectbox(
    "üë§ Your Role:",
    ["Business User", "Data Analyst", "Technical Expert"],
    help="Choose your role to customize the interface and analysis approach"
)
```

#### Added Profile Mapping:
```python
# Map string profile to enum
profile_mapping = {
    "Business User": UserProfile.BUSINESS_USER,
    "Data Analyst": UserProfile.DATA_ANALYST,
    "Technical Expert": UserProfile.TECHNICAL_EXPERT
}

return {
    'profile': profile,  # Keep as string for dashboard
    'profile_enum': profile_mapping.get(profile, UserProfile.BUSINESS_USER),  # Enum for business logic
    # ... other config
}
```

### 2. Dark Mode Enhancement
**File**: `ui_components.py` - Enhanced `apply_dark_theme()` method

#### Added Comprehensive CSS Selectors:
- Force dark mode with multiple container selectors
- Override any light theme remnants
- Enhanced sidebar styling with multiple compatibility selectors
- Added extensive form controls styling
- Covered all Streamlit components including:
  - Metrics, alerts, progress bars
  - Form inputs (text, textarea, number, date, time)
  - Multiselect, radio buttons, checkboxes
  - File uploader, expanders, tabs
  - DataFrames and tables
  - Plotly charts
  - Headers and markdown content

#### Main App Early Theme Application:
**File**: `app_enhanced.py`

```python
def main():
    """Main application function"""
    
    # Apply dark theme first - before any other UI elements
    UIStyleManager.apply_dark_theme()
    
    # Force page theme to dark mode with additional CSS injection
    st.markdown("""
    <style>
        /* Force dark theme immediately */
        .stApp, [data-testid="stAppViewContainer"], [data-testid="stHeader"] {
            background-color: #0e1117 !important;
            color: #fafafa !important;
        }
        
        /* Hide any default Streamlit styling that might interfere */
        #MainMenu {visibility: hidden;}
        .stDeployButton {display:none;}
        footer {visibility: hidden;}
        
        /* Apply dark theme to everything immediately */
        * {
            background-color: inherit !important;
            color: inherit !important;
        }
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build and Push Docker Image
```bash
az acr build --registry crzquw4tzk6yqss --image anomaly-app:v2.2 . --timeout 1200
```

### 2. Update Container App
```bash
az containerapp update --name ca-zquw4tzk6yqss --resource-group rg-anomalydetection --image crzquw4tzk6yqss.azurecr.io/anomaly-app:v2.2
```

### 3. Validation
- Health check: ‚úÖ `curl -f https://ca-zquw4tzk6yqss.blueforest-35c35620.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io/_stcore/health` returns "ok"
- Logs: ‚úÖ No errors in application logs
- Browser test: ‚úÖ Application loads successfully with dark theme

## Testing Results

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
